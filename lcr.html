            <h2><i>Agreeing to Disagree: Statutory Relational Stance Modeling</i></h2>
            <h5>A (Work-in-Process) Senior Thesis</h5>
            <p>Policy division deeply affects which bills get passed in legislature, and how. So far, statutory NLP has predicted voting breakdowns, interpreted stakeholder benefit, informed legal decision support systems, and much more. In practice, legislation demands compromise and concession to pass important policy, yet models often struggle to reason over the whole act. Leveraging neuro-symbolic models, we seek to intermediate this challenge with relational structures of statutes’ sectional stances – modeling stance agreement, exception, etc. Beyond supporting downstream statutory analysis tasks, these structures could help stakeholders understand how a bill impacts them, litmus the cooperation within a legislature, and reveal patterns of compromise that aid a bill through ratification.</p>
