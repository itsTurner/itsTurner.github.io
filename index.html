                    <h3>Inner Product Methods in Neural Networks</h3>
                    <h5>April 2023 ‚Äì Present</h5>
                    <p>Foundationally, neural networks are not fully understood in many ways. The attempt to progress their comprehension opens the door to a rich ecosystem of modifying, reframing, and reconsidering the models according to our interests that has resulted in the dramatic and sudden diversity in neural learning models today. One assumption that has overwhelmingly remained true over their rapid growth, however, is use of the dot product to apply weights to a neuron‚Äôs input. We incise on the question: why the dot product? By framing inner products as measures of information explanation and correspondence, we can identify the neural network model as a non-linearized, repeated measure of explanation over the output of one layer and the weights of the next. We find that this complex transformation alters the spatial behaviors over models trained under otherwise identical conditions. This confirmation induces further exploration over how to engineer these spaces to specify that transformation, as well as, how to mitigate or harness asymptotic behavior.</p>

                    <h5>January 2021</h5>
                    <p>We demonstrate the nearest centroid classification via implementations in 1) a fully classical model and 2) a model taking advantage of quantum distance estimation. Nearest centroid clustering was used to identify game state advantage in generated game boards, with comparable applications beyond the given application, from rapid medical classification to sentiment analysis. The quantum model is compared with the classical model to evaluate the efficacy of the quantum model in comparison to that of the classical model. Additionally, this comparison is gameified, pitting human, classical, and quantum classifications against each other in an interactive game.</p>
